  <h1>About Me Quiz!</h1>
  <p>After attending military training in Texas, I graduated from the University of Washington and promptly took a job as an accounting clerk at Bank of America. After work I would walk to Key Arena and work my night job at the Seattle Sonics Team Shop.</p>

  <p>I decided to leave the accounting field and later took a position as a marketing analyst at Full Beaker in Bellevue.</p>
